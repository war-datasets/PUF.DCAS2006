This file contains the casualty records of all U.S. military personnel who died during calendar year 2006. The casualties occurred worldwide and resulted from both hostile and non-hostile action. Although other wars are represented in the 1950 - 2005 casualty records file, all of the 2006 casualties are designated as occurring during either the War on Terrorism or during Peacetime. Because of the breadth of the category of Peacetime, several fields further describe those casualties in terms of location, circumstances, category, and reason. Each record may include such information as: the service member's name, service number, service branch, rank, pay grade, occupation, birth date, gender, home of record (city, county, state or province, country), marital status, religion, race, ethnicity, casualty circumstances, casualty location (city, state or province, country or over water), unit, duty, process date, death date, war or conflict, operation incident type, hostile or non-hostile death indicator, casualty type, casualty category, and remains recovered. Since this is the public use version of the file, the service number field is masked.
